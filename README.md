# Fluxus

> flū̆xus *[adjective]* - to flow

> [!NOTE]
> Fluxus is a major work-in-progress and will be for a long time- likely years. The goal is to create a well rounded and powerful DJ app that serves as a serious alternative to proprietary and paid apps such as Rekordbox and Traktor. This *will* take time- keep an eye on the [projects board](https://github.com/users/averwhy/projects/8) for overall status.

High-performance DJ software built for flexibility and control- DJ'ing for the rest of us. Inspired by the international avant-garde art movement of the 1950s and 1960s called *Fluxus*. [Read more about the project here](https://github.com/averwhy/Fluxus/discussions/1#discussion-9520616).

Created with Swift for MacOS, Fluxus aims to be a powerful, feature-first DJ software compatible with any[^2] DJ controller and/or MIDI device.
