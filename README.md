# Fluxus

> flū̆xus *[adjective]* - to flow

Inspired by the international avant-garde art movement of the 1950s and 1960s of artists, poets, and musicians whose goal was to integrate life into art through the use of "found events, sounds, and materials, thereby bringing about social and economic change in the art world".[^1]

> [!NOTE]
> Fluxus is a major work-in-progress and will be for a long time- likely years. The goal is to create a well rounded and powerful DJ app that serves as a serious alternative to proprietary and paid apps such as Rekordbox and Traktor. This *will* take time- keep an eye on the [projects board](https://github.com/users/averwhy/projects/8) for overall status.

High-performance DJ software built for flexibility and control- DJ'ing for the rest of us. [Read more about Fluxus here](https://github.com/averwhy/Fluxus/discussions/1#discussion-9520616).

Created with Swift for MacOS, Fluxus aims to be a powerful, feature-first DJ software compatible with any[^2] DJ controller and/or MIDI device.
